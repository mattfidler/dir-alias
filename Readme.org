#+TITLE: dir-alias: Create emacs specific directory shortcuts
#+AUTHOR: Matthew L. Fidler
* Package motivation

This was originally made for EmacsPortable.App.  EmacsPortable.App
runs emacs off a usb or removable drive.  When running an application
off the USB drive, the directories will change based on the system
running. For example, the usb may be on =/Volumes/USB/= or
=/mnt/hda1/= or =e:/=.  To make things consistent between platforms,
this package creates abbreviated file names that should be consistent
between every platform.  In each case, this would be abbreviated to
=~usb/=.

After using this for some time, I found the abbreviations useful for
many directories, and thought that others may also like the directory
shortcuts.
   
* EmacsPortable.App specific shortcuts
When using EmacsPortable.App, the following directories aliaes are setup:
|-------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------|
| Alias       | True Directory               | Directory Purpose                   |
|-------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------|
| ~ahk/       | Other/source/ahk             | AHK Sources Directory               |
| ~app/       | App/                         | EmacsPortable.App Application Files |
| ~ep/        | .                            | EmacsPortable.App Directory         |
| ~ini/       | Data/ini                     | EmacsPortable.App ini files         |
| ~nsi/       | Other/source/nsi             | NSIS Sources Directory              |
| ~pa/        | USB Drive:/PortableApps      | Portable Apps                       |
| ~shared/    | Data/start/shared            | Shared Customizations               |
| ~site-lisp/ | App/site-lisp                | Site Lisp Directory                 |
| ~src/       | Data/src                     | EmacsPortable.App lisp source files |
| ~start/     | Data/start                   | EmacsPortable.App Customizations    |
| ~system/    | Data/start/system            | System-based Customizations         |
| ~usb/       | USB Drive                    | USB Drive                           |
| ~user/      | Data/start/user              | User-based Customizations           |
| ~h/         | System Home Directory        | System Home Directory               |
|-------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------------|

In addition to these aliases, the following aliases are also defined:

- All the directories in =~src/= are expanded into abbreviations.  For
  example, if you had =dir-alias= in =~src/=, the overall alias would
  be =~dir-alias/=

* General shortcuts
With or without EmacsPortable.App, the following aliases are added:
|----------+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
| Alias    | True Directory              | Directory Purpose                         |
|----------+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
| ~ed/     | ~/.emacs.d/                 | Emacs Settings Directory                  |
| ~doc/    | ~/Documents                 | User Documents directory                  |
| ~el-get/ | el-get package directory    | Main el-get package directory             |
| ~snip/   | main yasnippet directory    | Root directory of user-defined yasnippets |
| ~git/    | ~/git or ~/github directory | Repository of git files                   |
| ~org/    | ~/org directory             | ~org root                                 |
|----------+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
* Creating your own aliases
Aliases can be created from environmental variables, or specifying
them in your startup 
** Environmental variable aliases 
You can setup variable aliases easily by just specifying them in
=dir-alias-env=.  For example, =dir-alias= sets up the following aliaeses.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (dir-alias-env "mydoc"
                 "temp"
                 "ProgramData"
                 '("pd" "ProgramData")
                 "ProgramFiles"
                 '("pf" "ProgramFiles")
                 "userprofile"
                 '("up" "userprofile")
                 "appdata"
                 ;; "homepath"
                 "systemroot"
                 '("win" "systemroot")
                 "localappdata"
                 '("h" "ohome"))
#+END_SRC

For all specified environmental variables as strings, like "mydoc" or
"temp":
- dir-alias makes sure the environmental variable specifies a
  directory
- If the environmental variable specifies a directory, setup an alias 
  for the environmental variable based on its name. For example
  "mydoc" would be aliased to =~mydoc/=.

When the argument is a list instead, the first string represents the
alias, and the second string represents the file environmental
variable.  For example ='("h" "ohome")= says that if there is an
enviromental variable =OHOME= that has a directory that exists, setup
the alias =~h/= to access that directory.

Whenever an alias already exists, ignore the new alias when using
=dir-alias-env=.  If you wish to overwrite any alias, you need to use
=dir-alias-env-force=.

Note that these alias are setup at the time =dir-alias= is loaded. If
these environmental variables change, they are not updated in =dir-alias=.
