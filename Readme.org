#+TITLE: dir-alias: Create emacs specific directory shortcuts
#+AUTHOR: Matthew L. Fidler

This was originally made for EmacsPortable.App, and used to help
figure out the correct directories between operating systems because
the usb drive gets mounted to different places. It is a convenient
shortcut facility for directories.
   
* EmcasPortable.App specific shortcuts
When using EmacsPortable.App, the following directories aliaes are setup:

In addition to these aliases, the following aliases are also defined:


*  General shortcuts
Other aliases are added =~el-get/package/elpa= is changed to =~elpa=, as
if it were a symbolic link.  Since symbolic links are not supported in
windows, this is handled by emacs only.  This was implemented to allow
files to remain the same between file systems.  =~usb/= will be the
same on every system.

In addition to these aliases, the following aliases are also defined:

- =~el-get=, is an alias for the el-get package directory
- =~elpa=, is an alias for the user elpa package directory
- =~theme= or =~themes=, is an alias for the emacs24 themes directory,
  (as long as the themes directory is /not/ the =user-emacs-directory=).
- =~snip=, =~snips=, =~snippets=, =~snippet=, is an alias for
  yasnippets snippets.
- All the startup scripts in =Data/start= have an alias created for them.
